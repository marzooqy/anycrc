/* Apply the len bits at dat to crc using the CRC described in model. If dat
   is NULL, then return the initial CRC for this model.  This allows for the
   calculation of a CRC in pieces, where the first call must be with crc equal
   to the initial value for this CRC model. crc_bitwise() must only be used for
   model->width less than or equal to WORDBITS.

   This routine and all of the crc routines here can process the data a chunk
   at a time. For example, this will calculate the CRC of the sequence chunk1,
   chunk2, chunk3:

      word_t crc = model.init;
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk1, len1);
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk2, len2);
      crc = crc_bitwise(model, crc, chunk3, len3);

   The final value of crc is the CRC of the chunks in sequence.  The first call
   of crc_bitwise() gets the initial CRC value for this model. */

   byte-wise calculation of the given CRC model.  The table value is the
   internal CRC register contents after processing the byte.  If not reflected,
   then the CRC is pre-shifted left to the high end of WORDBITS so that the
   incoming byte can be exclusive-ored directly into a shifted CRC. */

   The entry in table_word[(n << 8) | k] is the CRC register contents after processing
   a byte with value k, followed by n zero bytes. For non-reflected CRCs, the
   CRC is shifted up to the top of the word. */

   not cycle, then model->back is -1. In either case, model->cycle entries of
